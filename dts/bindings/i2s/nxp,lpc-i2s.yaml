  framelength:
    type: int
    description: In most cases, frameLength is equal to bitWidth
        times lineChannels. In some cases, frameLength needs to be set to other value.
        For example, when the number of bit clock on the bus between two neighboring WS
        value is greater than bitWidth times lineChannels, frameLength needs to be set to
        the value that is equal to the number of bit clock between two neighboring WS signal.
        Ommit or set to 0 means use calculation of driver (default behaviour).
